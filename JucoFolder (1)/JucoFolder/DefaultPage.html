<h1>American Classic: Lacrosse Sport</h1>
<div class="section">
<h2>Quick Breakdown</h2>
<p>Lacrosse is a fast-paced, high-intensity team sport that originated with Indigenous North American communities.
    It combines elements of hockey, basketball, and soccer, with players using a lacrosse stick to catch, carry,
    and shoot a rubber ball into the opposing team’s goal.</p>

<h2>How to Execute the Behind-the-Back Shot</h2>
<p>The Behind-the-Back (BTB) Shot is a stylish and effective move in lacrosse.
    It’s used to surprise defenders and goalies, especially in tight angles near the crease.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Approach the goal from the side or behind,
    while keeping control of the ball in your stick.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Shift your hands slightly down the shaft for better leverage
    and prepare your body for a backward motion.</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> Rotate your shoulders and wrists to whip the stick behind
    your back, releasing the ball with an unexpected angle.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-through:</strong> Finish the motion smoothly to maintain balance and avoid turnovers.</li>
</ol>

<h2>History of Lacrosse</h2>
<p>Lacrosse has deep roots in Native American culture, particularly among tribes
    like the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois). It was originally played as a ceremonial sport,
    often involving hundreds of players and games that lasted for days. The modern version began evolving in the
    19th century when it was codified in Canada. Today, lacrosse is played at various levels around the world and is known for its speed, agility, and cultural heritage.</p>
